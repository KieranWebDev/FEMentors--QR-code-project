# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

My first challenge on Front-end Mentor; a very simple challenges. My main aim here was to get a grip on how the platform works, the process of submitting, and checking solutions, giving and recieving feedback and iterating and improving upon solutions
